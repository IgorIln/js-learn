All these methods are modal: they pause script execution and don’t allow the visitor to interact with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed.

There are two limitations shared by all the methods above:

    The exact location of the modal window is determined by the browser. Usually, it’s in the center.
    The exact look of the window also depends on the browser. We can’t modify it.
